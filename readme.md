# Robby Gaines's Front-End Project Proposal

## Not So Fifa Soccer
My prodject will be a game that is similiar to the user experience of Pong. It will be a two player game that only allows the user to move vertically while the ball will bouncing off everything except for the goal. It will keep track of points and the game will end after a certain amount of goals.

#Uses and Users

Uses and Users are kids, young adults, or anyone who wants to play an interactive computer game with a friend at the same time.

Outputs do they need? Users scores and ability to restart the game.

There are no inputs needed to play the game.

Technologies Used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, Canvas

#Features

The ball will be reactive to everything it comes in contact with. It will have a never ending response of bouncing off of the barriers of the game and the players in it. The ball will only disappear once it enters into the designated goal section.

Once the ball enters into the goal section of the player space the backend will record the action and output a point on the score board.

There will be two players able to play the game at the same thime. The bots in the game that the user controls will only have verticle movement as a response. The controls for player 1 will be the space bar to make the bot go down and the "C" key to make the bot go up. For player 2 the bot will respond to the up and down arrows.

A restart button will restart the scores and create a new game. If the restart button is not pushed the game will end after one team has recorded 5 goals on the scoreboard.


## Stretch

The stretch goal will be to make it alot more attractive with graphics and funcitons. Instead of only two player mode it could have option to choose 2 player or verse the Computer.
